# How to Create a Test Todo for Reminders

## Quick Steps

1. **Go to the Todo page**
2. **Fill in the form:**
   - Task: "Test reminder"
   - Priority: **Click on "3", "4", or "5"** (NOT 1 or 2!)
   - Due Time: Set to 15-30 minutes from now
   - Leave other fields as default
3. **Click "Add Todo"**
4. **Wait 5 seconds** (reminders refresh every minute)
5. **Check the bell icon** - should show a red badge

## Important: Priority Selection

The default priority is 1 (Highest), but reminders only show for priority 3, 4, 5.

**You MUST click on priority 3, 4, or 5 before adding the todo!**

## Why Reminders Only Show Priority 3, 4, 5?

The original design was:
- Priority 1, 2 = High priority (you should already know about these)
- Priority 3, 4, 5 = Lower priority (might forget, so show reminders)

## Suggested Fix

Would you like me to change the reminder system to show ALL priorities (1-5) instead of just 3-5?

This would make more sense since:
1. Default priority is 1
2. Most users won't change the priority
3. Reminders are useful for all tasks

Let me know and I can update the code!
